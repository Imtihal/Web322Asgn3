            I'm currently a student at Seneca College, I am on Semester 3 of the Computer Programming & Analysis program. In this semester, I am taking WEB322, SYD366, OOP345, DBS311 and one elective course. I still don't know exactly which expertise I want to pursue, I have looked at Cloud Development and even Cybersecurity, however this program doesn't offer much for Cybersecurity, so I am still exploring my options. I was thinking of branching off to university and complete my bachelor's degree in Computer Science which I can then later on possibly major in Cybersecurity, but I am not entirely sure yet. I was also thinking of just staying on the route of Software Development and was also thinking of going into McMaster's Btech program for Software Engineering but we'll see how things go in the future after I get closer to graduating from the CPA program.

            In my free time, I like to play video games, go biking, I also love motorcycles but I don't own one yet here in Canada, I used to own one back in abroad, and ever since then I've been missing the thrill of being on a motorcycle. I also like to go out with family and friends. I definitely love travelling and exploring new places which I used to do when I owned a motorcycle. Now I'm mostly just exploring using my bicycle here in Toronto, which is still fun but doesn't compare with travelling by car or motorcycle to far away places.
